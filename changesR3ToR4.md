Changing an ImplementationGuide from R3 to R4

- Adapt ig.json to new FHIR Version and structure
- Convert the StructutreDefintions from R3 with R4 with the convert fucnctionaliy of matchbox
- Adjust problems in differentials in StructureDefintions (which have to be later adapated also in examples)

QuestionnaireRespone.questionnaire instead of QuestionnaireRespone.reference

**MedicationStatement.taken has an element that is not marked with a snapshot match**
taken muss noch aus Beispielen entfernt werden, wird nicht mehr gebraucht (converter als Extension durchlassen oder vergessen?, bei der zur√ºckkonvertierung brauchte es das wahrscheinlicb sonst nicht schemakonform: http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/medicationstatement-definitions.html#MedicationStatement.taken)


**MedicationStatement.dosage.dose[x] has an element that is not marked with a snapshot match**
**MedicationStatement.dosage.doseAndRate.rate[x] has an element that is not marked with a snapshot match**
**MedicationRequest.dosageInstruction.dose[x] has an element that is not marked with a snapshot match**
**MedicationRequest.dosageInstruction.rate[x] has an element that is not marked with a snapshot match**

In STU3 0.* Dosage, Dosage has 0..1 rate[x] and 0..1 dose[x]
In R4 0.* Dosage, Dosage has 0..* doseRate with 0..1 rate[x] and  0..1 dose[x]

TODO: Need to create a profile probably on Dosage which will mapp the STU3 datalement to R4 for MedicationStatment/MedicationRequest


**Error in snapshot generation: Differential for http://chmed16af.emediplan.ch/fhir/StructureDefinition/chmed16af-rx-medicationrequest with id:** 
**MedicationRequest.substitution.allowed has an element that is not marked with a snapshot match**
TODO is now allowed[x], restricted back to booelan, needs to be adjusted in examples, converter


**Condition.clinicalStatus: illegal constrained type code from CodeableConcept**

TOOD: verify which Elements have been added in R3 to Medicastion* and which should be set to 0 according to CHMED16AF
